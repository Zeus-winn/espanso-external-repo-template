    replace: |
      The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is like the brain of your computer. It handles most of the work, like running programs and processing data. The CPU's speed and the number of cores it has determine how fast your computer can perform tasks. It's an essential part of what makes your computer work efficiently.
  - trigger: ":onboarding_what_is_ram"
    replace: |
      RAM, or Random Access Memory, is like your computer's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data and programs that your computer is currently using, so it can access them quickly. More RAM helps your computer run faster and handle multiple tasks at once without slowing down. It's essential for smooth performance, especially when using several applications at the same time.

      A GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is like the part of your computer that handles visuals and graphics. It helps create the images and videos you see on your screen, making things look smoother and more detailed. The GPU is especially important for tasks like gaming, video editing, and running graphics-intensive applications. Having a good GPU can make your computer run these tasks faster and with better quality.

      Yes, it is safe to connect your Gmail account. When decide to log into the app with your Gmail account, the app securely gets your basic info (such as your email address and name) from Google to create or access your account. This way, you don’t need a separate password.

      To provide you the best user experience possible, our Champions in the Hivello developer team built the application with the mindset “Set and forget”. This means that you don’t need to proactively manage and track your installed networks. However, if you want to, you can easily do that from the “Dashboard” tab. 
      Within the Dashboard, you will see all available networks, their status (e.g., “Up and running” - your already installed networks; or “Install” - networks that are not installed), actions you could take (“Uninstall”, “Stop”, “Reinstall”, “Restart”) and your earnings with the DePIN network/web3 project.
      To maximize your earning potential, we recommend you connect to all available networks and run the app as frequently as you can (even 24/7).

      The Hivello app is currently supporting 2 amazing projects/DePIN nodes: Mysterium and Livepeer. 
      Mysterium is a decentralized VPN service and open marketplace that enhances internet privacy and security using a global network of nodes. This approach distributes data across multiple points, making it harder for any single entity to monitor or control, ensuring secure, anonymous internet access. While contributing to Mysterium, we recommend you don't turn on your VPN on the local machine as this will block your earnings with Mysterium.
      Livepeer is a decentralized platform for video streaming that distributes video encoding tasks across a global network of nodes, reducing costs and enhancing scalability. It uses the native LPT token to incentivize participants and operates as an open-source, community-driven project. This decentralized approach enhances the privacy and security of video content.
